<!-- Q.1 <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it? simple 25 words

Ans.No, <!DOCTYPE html> is not an HTML tag. It is a document type declaration used to indicate that the document is written in HTML5. It helps browsers render the document correctly and allows developers to adhere to the standards and specifications of HTML5.



Q.2 Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?

Ans Semantic tags in HTML are elements that convey meaning and define the structure of web content. Examples include <header>, <nav>, <article>, and <footer>. They improve accessibility, search engine optimization, and facilitate easier understanding and maintenance of web pages by both humans and machines.

Q.3 Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements? 


Ans.HTML Tags: Tags are the markup symbols used in HTML to define the structure and elements of a web page. They are represented by angle brackets (<>), and usually, they come in pairs - an opening tag and a closing tag. For example: <p> is an opening tag, and </p> is a closing tag.

HTML Elements: Elements are made up of HTML tags, along with the content they enclose. An HTML element consists of the opening tag, the content (text or other elements), and the closing tag. For example: <p>Hello, this is a paragraph.</p> is an HTML element where <p> and </p> are the tags, and "Hello, this is a paragraph." is the content.

In summary, tags are the individual markup symbols used in HTML, while elements are complete structures made up of tags and their enclosed content. Elements are what give meaning and structure to a web page.
