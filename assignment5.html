Q.1 What’s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous?

Ans Synchronous operations occur sequentially and block further execution until they complete, while asynchronous operations allow for concurrent execution and do not block subsequent code, typically using callbacks, promises, or async/await.


Q.2 What are Web Apis ?

Ans Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and tools provided by web browsers to interact with web features, such as accessing and manipulating HTML elements, making HTTP requests, and handling browser events.

Q.3 Explain SetTimeOut and setInterval ?

Ans setTimeout is a JavaScript function that executes a callback function after a specified delay (in milliseconds). It triggers the function only once.
setInterval is similar but repeatedly executes the callback function at a specified interval until cleared or stopped.

Q.4 how can you handle Async code in JavaScript ?



In JavaScript, you can handle asynchronous code using techniques such as callbacks, promises, and async/await. Callbacks allow you to pass functions as arguments to be executed after asynchronous operations complete. Promises provide a more structured approach for handling async operations, while async/await simplifies async code using asynchronous functions and the await keyword.


Q.5 What are Callbacks &  Callback Hell ?


Ans Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are called at a specific point in the execution of the receiving function. Callback hell refers to a situation where multiple nested callbacks make the code difficult to read and maintain, leading to spaghetti-like code structure.



Q.6 What are Promises & Explain Some Three Methods of Promise



Ans  Promises are objects in JavaScript that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They have three important methods: then() attaches callbacks for successful completion, catch() handles errors, and finally() specifies code to be executed regardless of success or failure.


Q.7 What’s async & await Keyword in JavaScript

Ans The async and await keywords are part of JavaScript's asynchronous programming model. The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, which returns a promise. The await keyword is used within an async function to pause the execution and wait for a promise to resolve before proceeding. It helps in writing asynchronous code in a more synchronous and readable manner.


Q.8 Explain Purpose of Try and Catch Block & Why do we need it?

Ans The purpose of the try and catch block in JavaScript is to handle and manage exceptions or errors that may occur during the execution of code. It allows developers to gracefully handle exceptions, prevent program crashes, and provide fallback logic or error messages, enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of the code.



Q.9 Explain fetch

fetch is a web API in JavaScript used to make asynchronous network requests and retrieve resources from a specified URL.

Q.10 How do you define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using async/await?

To define an asynchronous function using async/await in JavaScript, use the async keyword before the function declaration. This allows the function to use await to pause execution until promises are resolved.
