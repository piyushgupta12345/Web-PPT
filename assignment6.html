Q.1 What’s Constructor And Its Purpose

<!-- A constructor is a special method in object-oriented programming used to initialize objects of a class. Its purpose is to set initial values and perform any necessary setup tasks. -->

Q.2 Explain This Keyword and Its Purpose?

<!-- The "this" keyword refers to the current instance of a class in object-oriented programming. Its purpose is to differentiate between instance variables and parameters with the same name, and to access or invoke other members of the class. -->


Q.3 What’s Call Apply Bind Method & Difference Between them

<!-- The "call," "apply," and "bind" methods are used to manipulate the context (the value of "this") in JavaScript functions. "call" and "apply" invoke the function immediately, while "bind" returns a new function with the context bound to a specific object. -->


Q.4 Explain OOPS ? 

<!-- OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It focuses on concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to structure and modularize software systems. -->


Q.5 Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?

<!-- Abstraction is a concept in object-oriented programming that focuses on hiding unnecessary implementation details and exposing only relevant information and functionality. Its purpose is to simplify complex systems, improve code maintainability, and provide a higher-level view for developers. -->


Q.6 Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?

<!-- Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on different forms or have multiple behaviors. Its purpose is to enable objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, providing flexibility, reusability, and extensibility in code design. -->


Q.7  Whats Inheritance and Purpose of it?

<!-- Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming where a class inherits properties and methods from another class. Its purpose is to promote code reuse, enable hierarchical relationships, and facilitate the creation of specialized classes based on existing ones. -->


Q.8 Whats Encapsulation and Purpose of it ? 


<!-- Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods into a single unit called an object. Its purpose is to hide the internal details of an object and provide access to it only through well-defined interfaces, promoting data security, modularity, and code organization. -->


Q.9 Explain Class in JavaScript?

<!-- In JavaScript, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects with predefined properties and methods. It allows for the creation of multiple instances (objects) based on the defined class structure, promoting code reusability and organization. -->



Q.10 What’s Super Keyword & What it does?

<!-- The "super" keyword in JavaScript is used to call and access the parent class's constructor and methods from within a subclass. It allows for overriding parent class behavior while retaining access to its functionality. -->
