Q.1 Explain Hoisting in JavaScript only ?

ANs  Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase before code execution.


Q.2 Explain Temporal Dead Zone?

Ans Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a period in JavaScript where variables declared with "let" and "const" are inaccessible and referencing them results in a "ReferenceError" until they are assigned a value.



Q.3 Difference between var & let?

Ans The main difference between "var" and "let" in JavaScript is their scope. "var" has function scope, while "let" has block scope. Additionally, "var" is hoisted, while "let" is not.


Q.4 What are the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6?

Ans ECMAScript 6, also known as ES6 or ES2015, introduced several major features to JavaScript. Some of the key features include:

Arrow functions
Block-scoped variables (let and const)
Classes and inheritance
Modules
Template literals
Default function parameters
Destructuring assignment

Q.5 What is the difference between let and const ?



The main difference between "let" and "const" in JavaScript is that "let" allows variable reassignment, while "const" creates a variable with a constant value that cannot be reassigned once defined.



Q.6  What is template literals in ES6 and how do you use them?

Ans Template literals, introduced in ES6, are a way to create strings with embedded expressions in JavaScript. They are denoted by backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes. To use template literals, you can include expressions within curly braces (${expression}) directly inside the string. This allows you to easily concatenate variables and expressions within the string without using string concatenation operators (+). Here's an example



const name = "Aryan";
const age = 20;

const message = `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;

console.log(message); // Output: My name is Aryan and I am 20 years old.



Q.7 Whatâ€™s difference between map & forEach?

Ans map returns a new array with transformed elements, while forEach iterates over array elements and executes a provided function, but does not create a new array.



Q.8 How can you destructure objects and arrays in ES6?

Ans  To destructure objects in ES6, use curly braces and assign variable names matching object properties. For arrays, use square brackets and assign variable names for each element in order.




.9 How can you define default parameter values in ES6 functions?

Ans In ES6, default parameter values can be defined by assigning a default value to a function parameter. If no argument is provided, the default value is used instead.



Q.10 What is the purpose of the spread operator (...) in ES6?

Ans  The spread operator in ES6 is used to unpack elements from arrays, objects, or iterables, allowing for easy copying, merging, and passing multiple arguments to functions in a concise manner.
