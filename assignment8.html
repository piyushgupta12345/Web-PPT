Q.1  Whats React and its pros and cons?


<!-- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its pros include component-based architecture, virtual DOM for efficient updates, while cons may include a steep learning curve and potentially complex setup for beginners.
 -->

 Q.2 What do you understand by Virtual Dom?


<!-- Virtual DOM is a concept in React where a lightweight copy of the actual DOM is created and used to track and update changes. It helps optimize rendering for improved performance. -->

Q.3 Difference between Virtual Dom vs Real Dom

<!-- Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM in memory, allowing for efficient updates and rendering. Real DOM is the actual HTML structure of a web page that can be directly manipulated, but is slower for updates. -->

Q.4 Whats component? Types of component


<!-- In React, a component is a reusable and self-contained building block of the user interface. There are two types of components: functional components (stateless) that receive props and return JSX, and class components (stateful) that inherit from React.Component and manage state. -->

Q.5 Difference between class & function based component


<!-- Class-based components are defined as ES6 classes and can have state and lifecycle methods. Functional components are defined as JavaScript functions and are stateless, relying on props for data input. -->

Q.6 Explain react component life cycle 

<!-- React component lifecycle refers to the series of phases a component goes through, including mounting, updating, and unmounting. It allows for executing code at specific points in a component's lifespan, such as initialization, rendering, and disposal. -->

Q.7 Explain Prop Drilling in React & Ways to avoid it 

<!-- Prop drilling in React occurs when props are passed through multiple intermediate components unnecessarily. To avoid it, you can use techniques like context API, component composition, or state management libraries like Redux or MobX. -->
